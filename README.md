# QuantumOpticalCircuits.jl

**QuantumOpticalCircuits.jl** is a numerical framework for the simulation of parametric quantum optical circuits.
Written in [JULIA](https://julialang.org), this package aim for efficient and accurate quantum optics simulations, while keeping simplicity of use at its core.

## üéÅ Installation

This package is still in developpement and is thus not yet available in Julia's General Regisitries.
Installing is done using git

```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/xvalcarce/QuantumOpticalCircuits.jl
```

## üëÄ Overview

`QuantumOpticalCircuits.jl` simulate quanutm optical circuits from 3 components: `States`, `OpticalDevices`, and `Measures`.  

A `n`-mode state can be a `FockState(n,d)`, a `GaussianState(n)` or a `PseudoGaussianState(n)`. The first type uses the Fock representation where `d` is the maximum number of photons considered. The last two type uses a Gaussian representation. `PseudoGaussianState` allows for non-Gaussian operation such as heralding operations (this is done by allowing the state to be a linear combination of Gaussian states).

Optical devices are `Operators` applied on specific optical modes. `Operators` implemented are phase-shifters (`PS`), displacements (`D`), single-mode squeezers (`SMS`), two-mode squeezers (`TMS`) and beam-splitters (`BS`).

Measurement are embbed in a type that can be applied on any state. We provide non-photon number resolving photon detector (`PhotonDetector`) and heralding operation (`Heradling`). Homodyne measurement are WIP.

Simple example:
```julia
julia> using QuantumOpticalCircuits
# 2-mode vacuum state using Gaussian represenation
julia> state = GaussianState(2)
# Let's apply a squeezing operation on mode 2, followed by a 50:50 beam-splitter between mode 1 and 2
julia> state = state |> SMS(0.42)(2) |> BS(œÄ/4)(1,2)
# Finally, let's measure the probability to get a click in the 1st mode with a photon detector with 80% efficiency
julia> state |> PhotonDetector(1,Œ∑=0.8)
0.05495903420401427
# Or in one-line
julia> GaussianState(2) |> SMS(0.42)(2) |> BS(œÄ/4)(1,2) |> PhotonDetector(1,Œ∑=0.8)
0.05495903420401427
# Or using the Fock representation with a cut-off at 5 photons
julia> FockState(2,5) |> SMS(0.42)(2) |> BS(œÄ/4)(1,2) |> PhotonDetector(1,Œ∑=0.8)
